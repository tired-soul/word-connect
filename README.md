I came accross a mobile game, where you get set of letters. And I have to find out proper english words out of them, across different length sizes. For example,



	Enter prompt: top


	['opt', 'pot', 'top']

	Enter prompt: word


	['dor', 'dow', 'ord', 'owd', 'rod', 'row', 'rwd', 'wod', 'wro', 'drow', 'word']



All words are compared against list of words from text file, and so some of words may make less sense.
